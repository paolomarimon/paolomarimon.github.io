Hi! I am Paolo Marimon. I am a postdoc at TU Wien at the Institut für Diskrete Mathematik und Geometrie. My main fields of research is model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

I am also running a reading group on [Infinite Domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems](http://https://cspreadingroup.github.io/). Please write to me if you are interested in joining the reading group.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
