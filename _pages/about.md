Hi! I am Paolo Marimon. I am currently a postdoc in the [Algebra group](https://dmg.tuwien.ac.at/fg1/UA.html) at TU Wien working for the [POCOCOP](https://pococop.eu/) project.

My research is in model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and on infinite domain Constraint Satisfaction problems (CSPs). 

I am also running a reading group on [Infinite Domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems](https://cspreadingroup.github.io/). Please write to me if you are interested in joining the reading group.
