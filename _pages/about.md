Hi! I am Paolo Marimon. I am currently a Senior Research Associate in the [Algorithms and Complexity](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/algorithms/) research group of the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford. I am employed by the UKRI ERC Guarantee Grant [NAASP](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/naasp.html) (New Approaches to Approximability of Satisfiable Problems).

Previously I was a postdoc in the [Algebra group](https://dmg.tuwien.ac.at/fg1/UA.html) at TU Wien working for the ERC Synergy Grant [POCOCOP](https://pococop.eu/).

My research is in model theory (a branch of mathematical logic) and on infinite domain Constraint Satisfaction problems (CSPs).
