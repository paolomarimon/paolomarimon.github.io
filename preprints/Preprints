abstract = {A collection {\mathcal C} of finite \mathcal{L}-structures is a {\em 1-dimensional asymptotic class\/} if for every m \in {\mathbb N} and every formula \varphi(x,\bar{y}), where \bar{y}=(y_1,\ldots,y_m): \begin{itemize} \item[(i)] There is a positive constant C and a finite set E\subset {\mathbb R}^{>0} such that for every M\in {\mathcal C} and \bar{a}\in M^m, either |\varphi(M,\bar{a})|\leq C, or for some \mu\in E, \big||\varphi(M,\bar{a})|-\mu |M|\big| \leq C|M|^{\frac{1}{2}}. \item[(ii)] For every \mu\in E, there is an \mathcal{L}-formula \varphi_{\mu}(\bar{y}), such that \varphi_{\mu}(M^m) is precisely the set of \bar{a}\in M^m with \big||\varphi(M,\bar{a})|-\mu |M|\big| \leq C|M|^{\frac{1}{2}}. \end{itemize} One-dimensional asymptotic classes are introduced and studied here. These classes come equipped with a notion of dimension that is intended to provide for the study of classes of finite structures a concept that is central in the development of model theory for infinite structures. Connections with the model theory of infinite structures are also drawn.},

This allows us to verify some of their properties (weak elimination of imaginaries, simplicity, the nature of forking, CM-triviality and stable forking) in a uniform way, and to show that these properties are preserved by iterations of the construction.},
