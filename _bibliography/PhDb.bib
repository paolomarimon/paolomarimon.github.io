These classes come equipped with a notion of dimension that is intended to provide for the study of classes of finite structures a concept that is central in the development of model theory for infinite structures. Connections with the model theory of infinite structures are also drawn.},

abstract = {A relational first order structure is homogeneous if it is countable (possibly finite) and every isomorphism between finite substructures extends to an automorphism. This article is a survey of several aspects of homogeneity, with emphasis on countably infinite homogeneous structures. These arise as FraissÃ© limits of amalgamation classes of finite structures. The subject has connections to model theory, to permutation group theory, to combinatorics (for example through combinatorial enumeration, and through Ramsey theory), and to descriptive set theory. Recently there has been a focus on connections to topological dynamics, and to constraint satisfaction. The article discusses connections between these topics, with an emphasis on examples, and on special properties of an amalgamation class which yield important consequences for the automorphism group.}

Many of these applications are treated in this book. This second edition is an expanded and updated version of what has become a classic basic reference in the subject.},

@book{Boga,
abstract = {Measure theory is a classical area of mathematics that continues intensive development and has fruitful connections with most other fields of mathematics as well as important applications in physics. This book gives a systematic presentation of modern measure theory as it has developed over the past century and offers three levels of presentation: a standard university graduate course, an advanced study containing some complements to the basic course (the material of this level corresponds to a variety of special courses), and, finally, more specialized topics partly covered by more than 850 exercises. Bibliographical and historical comments and an extensive bibliography with 2000 works covering more than a century are provided. Volume 1 is devoted to the classical theory of measure and integral. Whereas the first volume presents the ideas that go back mainly to Lebesgue, the second volume is to a large extent the result of the later development up to the recent years. The central subjects of Volume 2 are: transformations of measures, conditional measures, and weak convergence of measures. These topics are closely interwoven and form the heart of modern measure theory. The target readership includes graduate students interested in deeper knowledge of measure theory, instructors of courses in measure and integration theory, and researchers in all fields of mathematics. The book may serve as a source for many advanced courses or as a reference.},

Beginning by developing the basics of ergodic theory and progressing to describe some recent applications to number theory, this book goes beyond the standard texts in this topic. Applications include Weyl's polynomial equidistribution theorem, the ergodic proof of Szemeredi's theorem, the connection between the continued fraction map and the modular surface, and a proof of the equidistribution of horocycle orbits. Ergodic Theory with a view towards Number Theory will appeal to mathematicians with some standard background in measure theory and functional analysis. No background in ergodic theory or Lie theory is assumed, and a number of exercises and hints to problems are included, making this the perfect companion for graduate students and researchers in ergodic theory, homogenous dynamics or number theory.},

 abstract = {We address the classification of the possible finitely-additive probability measures on the Boolean algebra of definable subsets of M which are invariant under the natural action of $\operatorname{Aut}(M)$. This pursuit requires a generalization of Shelah's forking formulas [8] to "essentially measure zero" sets and an application of Myer's "rank diagram" [5] of the Boolean algebra under consideration. The classification is completed for a large class of ℵ0-categorical structures without the independence property including those which are stable.},
